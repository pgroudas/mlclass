### Neural Networks

## Non-linear hypothesis

Housing prediction with 100 features, as a classification problem.

Even with only order two polynomials, with 100 features thats 5000
features! (O(n^2)

Order three polynomials, you're up to about 170,000.

## Another example: Computer vision

Examine an image and tell if its a car.

Labeled training set (images).

Examine each pixel as a feature.  With a 50x50 image -> n=2500

Just with quadratic we're up to 3 million features!

## Neurons and the brain

Origins: Algorithms that try to mimic the brain.  Was very widely used
in 80's and 90's.  Recent resurgence: State-of-the-art technique for
many applications.

The "one learning algorithm" hypothesis.  Connecting Auditory cortext to
eyes, animals still learn to see.  Neural re-wiring experiments show
that same tissue can learn different things.
